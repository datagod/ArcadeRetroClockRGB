Arcade Retro Clock started out as a project on an 8x8 matrix.  Over the years it has been converted to 16x16 and now 64x32.  Each conversion process involved solving many bugs and enhancing the game play especially with respects to the computer's ability to play against itself.

There are 4 games that have been converted to this new playform so far.

**Outbreak**
<BR>Inspired by the computer program "Game of Life" and by a hunk of moldy cheese I keep nibbling at.  

Viruses moving around a petrie dish, consuming the light blue food. They will replicate, mutate, infect each other, change speed up or down. I wanted them to clump together and move in the same direction. Sometimes they shoot off an "explorer" that will infect other colonies. When a single color virus dominates for 50 moves, a message appears saying "infection cured" or something like that. The virus number is simply the RGB value of the winning color.

Fun fact: Outbreak is too long of a word to display on the new screen when doubling the font size, so I changed it to UTBR8K.  Either name works.

**PaKdot**
<BR>This is the first game I created on the 8x8 matrix.  With the larger display I now have enough room to actually draw a maze.  The little pakdot and ghosts are not very smart though and tend to get stuck.  You will see them wiggle back and forth in an effort to free themselves.  I will rewrite their logic to give them much better "vision" which will make the game smoother.

**Tron Lightcycle**
<BR>A fun game where players try to ram each other each other's jet walls.

**Astro Smash!**
<BR>Based on Intellivision Astrosmash. Ships cross the sky. Asteroids fall from the sky. Human ship is protecting the planet.
If the mother ship gets hit twice it gets angry and starts nuking.


**Special Effects**
<BR>There are multiple transitions between games. Screen zoom in/out, scrolling, glowing text.  The clock supports fully animated colored sprites as well.

**Clock**
<BR>It tells the time, day of week, month of year.

**Crypto Balance**
<BR>The clock will display the balance of a crytp wallet, converted to a currency.  The default is my Ether wallet and the currency is Canadian.
